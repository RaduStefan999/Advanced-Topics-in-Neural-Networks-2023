Summary
* I experimented with several models and configurations. Found a model that uses skip connection to perform the best. It reaches 44% validation accuracy.
* I logged training information on tensorboard as well as weights & biases
* I searched several configurations of optimizers to find the best one. The full search was done with less epochs. The 2 best performing models were ran on more epochs.
