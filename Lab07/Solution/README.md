Summary
* I implemented my own convolutional layer using basic tensor operations. I made use of tensor unfold to obtain the matrix slices. I tested my implementation against the standard one to see that the results are the same.
* I used a ConvMixer neural network to train a model on the Cifar-10 dataset. I managed to obtain 95% accuracy. I provided an inference.py script in order to thest the model.
* I also documented the way in which ConvMixer works.
